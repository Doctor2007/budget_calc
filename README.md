CSV File is a random generated file that makes no sense, but follows the structure of a CSV file you can download yourself. It is only an example


This is a script made to process information about personal bank statements. Right now it is only working with monobank. In their app you can download an CSV file that has following structure:

"Date and time",Description,MCC,"Card currency amount, (UAH)","Operation amount","Operation currency","Exchange rate","Commission, (UAH)","Cashback amount, (UAH)",Balance


I will be working more about adapting this program for other banks in the future


**How to use?
**

Download files -> put your CSV file into bills folder -> change the setting in init() main.py, adjust path in data_init().
